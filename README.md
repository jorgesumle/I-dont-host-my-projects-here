## Why?

Github itself is proprietary, so I choose to host my active projects on
[NotABug](https://notabug.org/). NotABug uses a liberated version of
Gogs and only hosts projects that are free software, so I encourage you
to use notabug instead of github as well. You can find my projects in
<https://notabug.org/jorgesumle/>
